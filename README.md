# I said this is not XML

1. XML is the abbreviation of *Extensible Markup Language*
2. Therefore, XML is a markup language
3. NotXML, however, is Turing Complete
4. Thus, NotXML is definitely not XML
5. Q.E.D.

Being a concise programming language, *NotXML* does have some advantages though. 

- **Integrated garbage collection**: Well, the interpreter is written in C#, so ...
- **Functional Programming**: You won't need to declare mutable local variables anyway. 
- **Dynamic Type System**: I'm pretty sure implicitly converting `string` to `int`, or `double` back and forth all the time would be such a convenience. 
- **Concise keywords**: There are only 4 keywords: `fun`, `par`, `app` and `id`, quite straight forward. Everyone should be able to figure out these meanings easily. 
- **Basic Linting Support**: Since the code is highly structuralized, you can apply XSD schemas to provide basic linting in some text editors. 
- **Verbose Syntax**: It keeps you away from almost every possible syntax errors, given that you have a text editor that is capable of auto completion.
